# kal3a-tags

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Set the environment variable `KAL3A_TARGET` to the URL for our kal3a instance before building.

```bash
export KAL3A_TARGET=http://kal3a.r-shief.org
grunt build
```

Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma. However, they do not pass right now.
